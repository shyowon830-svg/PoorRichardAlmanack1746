XI Mon. January hath xxxi days.
Nothing exceeds in Ridicule, no doubt,
A Fool in Fashion, but a Fool that’s out;
His Passion for Absurdity’s so strong
He cannot bear a Rival in the Wrong.
Tho’ wrong the Mode, comply; more Sense is shewn
In wearing others Follies than your own.
If what is out of Fashion most you prize,
Methinks you should endeavour to be wise.
