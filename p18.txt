VI Mon. August hath xxxi days.
Can Gold calm Passion, or make Reason shine;
Can we dig Peace or Wisdom from the Mine?
Wisdom to Gold prefer, for â€™tis much less
To make our Fortune, than our Happiness.
That Happiness which Great Ones often see,
With Rage and Wonder, in a low Degree,
Themselves unblest. The Poor are only poor;
But what are they who droop amid their Store?
