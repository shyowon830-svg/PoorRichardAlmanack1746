show that the Sun rises that Day 17 Minutes after 7,
and sets 17 Minutes before 5. I have chose to put
the Sun’s rising and setting for every Day, rather than 
the Moon’ s, because of its constant Ufe in Setting of 
Clocks and Watches.

Moon, I have put her rising and setting every now
and then : If you want to know her rising and setting
on any Day between thofe againft which T have
set it, the common Auile of three Quarters of an hour
later each Day, wil! be exa& enough to dire& Peo-
