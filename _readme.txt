Explanation of Metadata Choices:

The metadata was designed to capture both the descriptive and contextual information of each individual image file from Poor Richard: An Almanack (1746). Each row corresponds to a single page and includes a simplified “unique_identifier” derived from the number of the Colenda along with the “page_number” for clear sequencing. Core bibliographic elements such as “title”, “author”, and “published_date” were included to preserve provenance, and administrative metadata fields like “language”, “genre”, and “type” were included as essential information for cataloging. Additional descriptive fields, including “content”, “physical_description,” and “keywords” were added to enable deeper textual or material analysis of the almanac’s contents and conditions. Overall, I curated the metadata to balance precision and accessibility: it includes enough detail to support scholarly discovery and digital edition work while remaining streamlined for efficient organization and interoperability across digital platforms.

Reflection and Explanation on Text Extraction
I used OCR by tesseract to extract the text from the almanack. This posed several problems, notably the high frequency of error in the extraction due to the almanack being old and the ink being lost in many places; the old English 's' looking like an 'f' in every use; tables, symbols, greek letters, images, and footnotes unable to be extracted and looking like gibberish; and formatting being weird in several places rather than cleanly in line due to potentially the wrinkles and coloring of the almanack due to time passing since 1745. Thus, I had to do quite a lot of correcting, and after several pages of transcibing and almost entirely re-writing rather than error-fixing, chose to not transcribe the tables which made up a bulk of the almanack content with B. Franklin's observations of astronomy. Every single page required correcting and editing for this particular text because of its old nature and old English usage.
