Explanation of Metadata Choices:
The metadata was designed to capture both the descriptive and contextual information of each individual image file from Poor Richard: An Almanack (1746). Each row corresponds to a single page and includes a simplified “unique_identifier” derived from the number of the Colenda along with the “page_number” for clear sequencing. Core bibliographic elements such as “title”, “author”, and “published_date” were included to preserve provenance, and administrative metadata fields like “language”, “genre”, and “type” were included as essential information for cataloging. Additional descriptive fields, including “content”, “physical_description,” and “keywords” were added to enable deeper textual or material analysis of the almanac’s contents and conditions. Overall, I curated the metadata to balance precision and accessibility: it includes enough detail to support scholarly discovery and digital edition work while remaining streamlined for efficient organization and interoperability across digital platforms.
