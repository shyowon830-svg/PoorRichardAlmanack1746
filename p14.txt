I Mon. April hath xxx days.
Zara resembles Ætna crown’d with Snows,
Without she freezes, and within she glows;
Twice e’er the Sun descends, with Zeal inspir’d,
From the vain Converse of the World retir’d,
She reads the Psalms and Chapters of the Day,
In—some leud Novel, new Romance, or Play.
Thus gloomy Zara, with a solemn Grace,
Deceives Mankind, and hides behind her Face.
