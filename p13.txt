I Mon. March hath xxxi days.
O sacred Solitude! divine Retreat!
Choice of the Prudent! Envy of the Great!
By thy pure Stream, or in thy waving Shade,
We court fair Wisdom, that celestial Maid:
The genuine Offspring of her lovâ€™d Embrace,
(Strangers on Earth) are Innocence and Peace.
There blest with Health, with Business unperplext,
This Life we relish and ensure the next.
