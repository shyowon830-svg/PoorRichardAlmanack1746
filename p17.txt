V Mon. July hath xxxi days.
Who taught the rapid Winds to fly so fast,
Or shakes the Centre with his Western Blast?
Who from the Skies can a whole Deluge pour?
Who strikes thro’ Nature, with the solemn Roar
Of dreadful Thunder, points it where to fall,
And in fierce Light’ning wraps the flying Ball?
Not he who trembles at the darted Fires,
Falls at the Sound, and in the Flash expires.
