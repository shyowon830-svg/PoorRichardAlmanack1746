VII Mon. September hath xxx days.
Can Wealth give Happiness? look round and see,
What gay Distress! What splendid Misery!
Whatever Fortune lavishly can pour,
The Mind annihilates, and calls for more.
Wealth is a Cheat, believe not what it says;
Greatly it promises, but never pays.
Misers may startle, but they shall be told,
That Wealth is Bankrupt, and insolvent Gold.
