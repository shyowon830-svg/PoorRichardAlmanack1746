X Mon. December hath xxxi days.
What’s Female Beauty, but an Air divine,
Thro’ which the Mind’s all gentle Graces shine?
They, like the Sun, irradiate all between;
The Body charms, because the Soul is seen.
Hence, Men are often Captives of a Face,
They know not why, of no peculiar Grace.
Some Forms tho’ bright, no mortal Man can bear;
Some, none resist, tho’ not exceeding fair.
Tim and his Handsaw are good in their Place,
Tho’ not fit for preaching or shaving a face.
