IV Mon. June hath xxx days.
What’s Man’s Reward for all his Care and Toil?
But One; a female Friend’s endearing Smile:
A tender Smile, our Sorrow’s only Balm,
And in Life’s Tempest the sad Sailor’s Calm.
How have I seen a gentle Nymph draw nigh,
Peace in her Air, Persuasion in her Eye;
Victorious Tenderness, it all o’ercame,
Husbands look’d mild, and Savages grew tame.
