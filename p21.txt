IX Mon. November hath xxx days.
There are, who, tossing on the Bed of Vice,
For Flattery’s Opiate give the highest Price;
Yet from the saving Hand of Friendship turn,
Her Med’cines dread, her generous Offers spurn.
Deserted Greatness! who but pities thee?
By Crowds encompass’d, thou no Friend canst see.
Or should kind Truth invade thy tender Ear,
We pity still, for thou no Truth canst bear.
